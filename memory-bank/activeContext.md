# Active Context: Change WARNING Logs to INFO Level - COMPLETED âœ…

## Task: CHANGE WARNING LOGS TO INFO LEVEL - DONE ðŸŽ¯

### Problem Summary
The system had WARNING level logs for super admin poll deletion operations, and the user requested these be changed to INFO level instead.

### Changes Completed âœ…
1. **super_admin_endpoints.py:285** - `delete_poll_api()` function
   - âœ… Changed: `logger.warning(f"Super admin {current_user.username} deleted poll {poll_id}")` 
   - âœ… To: `logger.info(f"Super admin {current_user.username} deleted poll {poll_id}")`

2. **super_admin.py:531** - `delete_poll()` function  
   - âœ… Changed: `logger.warning(f"Super admin {admin_user_id} deleted poll {poll_id} ({poll_name})")`
   - âœ… To: `logger.info(f"Super admin {admin_user_id} deleted poll {poll_id} ({poll_name})")`

### Impact Analysis
- **Discord Notifications**: âœ… INFO logs won't trigger Discord notifications (BotOwnerLogHandler only processes WARNING+)
- **Audit Trail**: âœ… Still captured by standard logging system
- **Log Level Philosophy**: âœ… Poll deletions are now correctly classified as operational activities, not warnings

### Files Modified
- [`polly/super_admin_endpoints.py`](polly/super_admin_endpoints.py:285) - âœ… Changed WARNING to INFO
- [`polly/super_admin.py`](polly/super_admin.py:531) - âœ… Changed WARNING to INFO

### Expected Result
Super admin poll deletion operations will now generate INFO level logs instead of WARNING level logs:
- Same message content and format
- Same audit trail functionality  
- No Discord notifications (since INFO < WARNING threshold)
- Cleaner separation between operational logs (INFO) and actual warnings (WARNING)

## Status: COMPLETED âœ…
Both WARNING logs have been successfully changed to INFO level for super admin poll deletion operations.
